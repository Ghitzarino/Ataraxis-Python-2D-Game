## Description:
Ataraxis is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler game where players can choose one of three classes to explore a dungeon filled with enemies.
The goal is to navigate through the maze, defeat various enemy types, and face the final boss to achieve victory.

## Technologies Used:
* Python 3: Core language for the entire project.
* Pygame: Used for game mechanics, rendering, and user interaction.
* NumPy: Utilized sparingly for projectile trajectory calculations.

## How to Run:
* Navigate to the ./code folder in the project directory.
* Run the main.py file.
* In the menu:
  * Adjust volume in the settings if needed.
  * Start a new game by selecting one of three available classes.
* Gameplay Controls:
  * Movement: Use W, A, S, D.

The player navigates a maze-like dungeon, battling enemies and searching for the boss to secure victory.

## Challenges Faced:
* Sprite Management: Adjusting and resizing images to ensure visual consistency.
* Ambitious Features: Enemy design and behavior mechanics proved particularly challenging.
* Projectile Systems: Creating, positioning, and animating player projectiles.
* Integration: Merging individual contributions into a cohesive, functional game was the most time-consuming and difficult aspect.

### Ataraxis is the product of collaborative effort and creativity, offering an engaging dungeon-crawling experience with a blend of unique mechanics and polished design.
